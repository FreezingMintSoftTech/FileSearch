# FileSearch

## How it started

FileSearch was a helpless boring homework given by my new programming teacher. After having a good time with friends, one had the idea of overengineering that homework.

## How to write a plug-in for FileSearch

* Add the FileAlgorithm library to your project (or simple download the [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FileSearch/1.0.0)) :arrow_down:
* Basic implementation here :innocent:
* Compile your plug-in library :collision:
* Put your lib into the "Plugins" folder :eyes:
* Hope that it'll work :sweat_smile:
* Have fun searching for files! :wink:

## Note:

I've implemented the "TestingPurpose" attribute, which allows us to create algorithms which aren't working yet and which should only show up in "Debug" mode.

Happy coding! :necktie:
