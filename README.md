# FileSearch

## How it started

FileSearch was a helpless boring homework given by my new programming teacher. After having a good time with friends, one had the idea of overengineering that homework.

## Note:

I've implemented the "TestingPurpose" attribute, which allows us to create algorithms which aren't working yet and which should only show up in "Debug" mode.

Happy coding! :necktie:
