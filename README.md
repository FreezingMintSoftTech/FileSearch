# FileSearch

## How it started

FileSearch was a helpless boring homework given by my new programming teacher. After having a good time with friends, one had the idea of overengineering that homework.

## Features

The FileSearch project contains four majore features which are:

* File-Searching-Algorithms
* File-Examining-Algorithms
* The ability for YOU to write plugins for searching/examining files
* A cool looking and geniusly nasty animated Lines-Of-Code-Counter :neckbeard:

And the best part is -> it's ALL OpenSource! :grin:

## How to write a plug-in for FileSearch

* Add the FileAlgorithm library to your project (or simple download the [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FileSearch/1.0.0)) :arrow_down:
* Basic implementation here :innocent:
* Compile your plug-in library :collision:
* Put your lib into the "Plugins" folder :eyes:
* Hope that it'll work :sweat_smile:
* Have fun searching for files! :wink:

## Note:

I've implemented the "TestingPurpose" attribute, which allows us to create algorithms which aren't working yet and which should only show up in "Debug" mode.

## Finale thoughts

This was a fun project to design, not only because I'll need this kind of programm in the future, but also because it gave me a lesson in "Material Design". As for this project, I'm using WPF with a nice [template](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit).

Shoutouts to [ButchersBoy](https://github.com/ButchersBoy) and as always:

Happy coding! :necktie:
